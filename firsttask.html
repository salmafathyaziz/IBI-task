                    Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).
                     Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

                    Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.
                     Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
                    
                    For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.
                     Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.

                <p class="text-small">
                    Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML,
                     CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.
        The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. 
This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), 
different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.

                <p class="text-small">
                    Back end development (often called the “server-side” development), is the creation of everything that goes on behind the scenes of a website or application that the user can’t see. 

Data is collected from external servers and applications and filters this information back into the website to process user requests. If you’re buying something online, you enter your information into the website. That information will then be stored in a database that was created on a server and will be processed to purchase your item. All of these stages are part of backend development.

The back-end normally consists of an application, server and database. As you interact with a site by entering information, this information is stored in a database that resides on a server. Results are then returned to you to be displayed on the site as front-end code.

            <p class="text-small">
                HTML stands for hypertext markup language. It's made of keywords and commands that web designers use for creating websites. 
                HTML is the default language of websites and web-based documents. It helps a browser understand the structure and style of a document or files for viewing over the internet. It allows your web pages to host audio, videos, spreadsheets, 
                and other applications. It also facilitates navigation within web pages or between websites through hypertext.

            <p class="text-small">
                Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.

CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.

            <p class=" text-small">
                avaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.

Many browsers use JavaScript as a scripting language for doing dynamic things on the web. Any time you see a click-to-show dropdown menu, extra content added to a page, and dynamically changing element colors on a page, to name a few features, you're seeing the effects of JavaScript.

            <h2 >PHP</h2>
 
            <p class=" text-small">
                The abbreviation PHP initially stood for Personal Homepage. But now it is a recursive acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor. (It's recursive in the sense that the first word itself is an abbreviation, so the full meaning doesn't follow the abbreviation.)

The first version of PHP was launched 26 years ago. Now it's on version 8, released in November 2020, but version 7 remains the most widely used.

PHP runs on the Zend engine, which is the most popular implementation. There are some other implementations as well, like parrot, HPVM (Hip Hop Virtual Machine), and Hip Hop, created by Facebook.

PHP is mostly used for making web servers. It runs on the browser and is also capable of running in the command line. So, if you don't feel like showing your code output in the browser, you can show it in the terminal.

        <p class="text-small">
            Java is a widely used object-oriented programming language and software platform that runs on billions of devices, including notebook computers, mobile devices, gaming consoles, medical devices and many others. The rules and syntax of Java are based on the C and C++ languages.

One major advantage of developing software with Java is its portability. Once you have written code for a Java program on a notebook computer, it is very easy to move the code to a mobile device. When the language was invented in 1991 by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems (later acquired by Oracle), the primary goal was to be able to "write once, run anywhere."
